# Pepper’s Ghost Weather Display Workshop - 30 Min Agenda

## 1. Introduction & Setup (12 min)
- **What is Pepper’s Ghost?** Quick history & real-world uses (theater, museums, AR displays).  
- **Why use it for weather visualization?** Creating dynamic, interactive holograms.  
- **Hands-on:**  
  - Distribute prisms & peel off protective plastic.  
  - Position prisms on mobile devices & adjust angles.  
  - Load the pre-hosted version of the project (scan QR code).  

## 2. Live Demo & Hands-On Interaction (8 min)
- **Observe the illusion:** Participants view the floating weather hologram.  
- **Break down the effect:**  
  - How does mirroring create the illusion?  
  - How does depth perception play a role?  
- **Predefined transformations:**  
  - Participants press buttons to scale, rotate, and recolor elements.  
  - Discuss how small changes impact perception.  

## 3. Code Walkthrough Without Execution (7 min)
- **Display a read-only version of the code (projector).**  
- **Break it down visually:**  
  - **Three.js scene setup** → How 3D objects are placed in space.  
  - **Weather API logic** → How external data could change visuals dynamically.  
  - **Transformation buttons** → How interactivity is coded.  
- **Encourage discussion:** What other real-world applications can they think of?  

## 4. Wrap-Up & Code Sharing (3 min)
- **Recap:** How the illusion works & how we modified it.  
- **Provide code** via QR code or USB stick.  
- **Open floor** for final Q&A.
